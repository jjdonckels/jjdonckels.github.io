  <h3 class="sub-header">Hockey</h3>

  <p>
    I've been playing hockey since I was 8 years old, and it's one of my favorite things to do. 
    There's nothing like having the wind rush past you as you fly down the ice and shoot the puck into 
    the net, and it's a feeling I can't replicate anywhere else. Below is a video of me scoring a goal 
    in youth league when I was a kid!

  <h3 class="sub-header">Tennis</h3>

  <p>
    I love playing tennis in my free time! I played all through high school and being on the court with my friends and 
    teammates are my fondest memories from that time. It's a beautiful game and I'm grateful that I've been able to play 
    it at a high level. 
  </p>

  <div class="spacer"></div>

  <h3 class="sub-header">Working Out</h3>

  <p>
    My go-to method of blowing off steam and relieving stress is lifting weights in the gym. I've been consistently working out 
    for more than 2 years now, and it's amazing to see how I've gotten stronger and healthier, both physically and mentally, as I've 
    stuck with it.
  </p>

  <h3 class="sub-header">Piano</h3>

  <p>
    I enjoy playing piano in my free time. I love listening to music, and it's even better when I can listen to music that 
    I'm playing myself! I took lessons throughout my childhood and while I haven't mastered it, I know enough where I can 
    pick up any song if I practice. My favorite piece to play is "Nuvole Bianche" by Ludovico Einaudi. I also enjoy playing Christmas
    music during the holidays. 
  </p>

  <div class="spacer"></div>

  <h3 class="sub-header">TV and Video Games</h3>

  <p>
    I like to relax by watching TV and playing video games. My favorite shows to watch are sitcoms like The Big Bang Theory and Modern Family 
    because they're easy to watch and relax to after a long day. I also like playing video games in my spare time. My favorites are sports games 
    like NHL or MLB The Show and I also like to play Star Wars games. 
  </p>

  <div class="spacer"></div>

  <h3 class="sub-header">Books</h3>

  <p>
    Books help me learn and also let my imagination run wild. One of my favorite things to do is read fiction, usually fantasy,
    as I wind down before I go to sleep at night. It gets me off my phone and allows me lose myself in a different world. My favorites 
    are the Ranger's Apprentice and Brotherband series from John Flanagan and the Inheritance Cycle from Christopher Paolini. These books were my
    childhood and hold a special place in my heart, and I'll usually come back and reread them every few years because I love the journey so much.
