    This is where I'll talk about the SQL database project, maybe the 45J voting
    system project, and maybe the webjam hackathon webscraping grocery project.
  </p> -->

  <p>
    One of the projects I'm most proud of is a SQL style database project that 
    I made when I took a C++ data structures class in the spring of 2024. During
    this class, I learned about data structures and algorithms in C++, everything 
    from linked lists and arrays to stacks and queues to graphs and trees. 
  </p>

    <!-- <div class="top-left ">Example Binary Search Tree</div> -->
  </div>

  <div class="spacer"></div>

  <p>
    One of my favorite parts of this course was learning about the king of all algorithms,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search" class="external_link" target="_blank">
      binary search</a>, and how it relates to tree data structures like the binary search tree 
    pictured above, as well as variations on binary search trees like AVL trees and B trees, shown below. 
    It was very interesting to learn how the principles of binary search manifested themselves in data structures, and 
    it was interesting to learn how the trees adapt and change as they grow and shrink. 
  </p>

  </div>

  <div class="spacer"></div>

  <p>
    Learning about B Trees led into learning about B+ Trees, which added some extra
    functionality over the previous B Tree, allowing each leaf node to be connected to adjacent
    nodes through linked-list style links. This allows for efficient iteration through 
    sequential pieces of data, which is very important when it comes to querying databases.
  </p>

  <div class="spacer"></div>

  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="photos/bplustree.jpeg" alt="Diagram of a B+ Tree" id="bplustree_pic" style="width:80%">
  </div>

  <div class="spacer"></div>

  <p>
    B+ Trees make up the heart of the database. This is because we can use B+ Trees to create a map.
    A map takes a given key and maps it to some value. It can map first names to last names, 
    names to ID numbers, ID numbers to email addresses, and so on. Under the hood, The map is a B+ Tree 
    of key and value pairs, where the key is used in the B+ Tree to sort and search for everything, allowing 
    the user to efficiently find the value they're looking for. This is essentially how the data in the 
    database is queried and returned. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if you had a database of students with information like name, major, ID number, and so on, 
    you could map the ID number for each student to the rest of their information, allowing you to quickly 
    track down any student you want. In a nutshell, maps are what allow you to find the data you're looking for.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next we learned about multimaps, which is very similar to a normal map, but a given key maps to a list 
    of values rather than a single value. This means if you create a map where you map last names to first names, 
    The last name "Doe" will map to a list containing both "John" and "Jane," which effectively allows you to 
    access every person whose last name is "Doe". In the context of a database, this allows you to group all 
    the records that meet a given condition!
  </p>

  <p>
    So, if you have a database with a bunch of people and information about them, like first name, last name, 
    age, major, etc., you can use one multimap for each attribute where the key is the attribute itself and 
    it maps to a list of people who have that attribute. If we made it so the list of people who had the 
    desired attribute that the multimap returns was a list of unique ID numbers instead of the people themselves, we can then use another 
    map at the end to map the ID number to the desired person! This saves space in all of our multimaps by only 
    needing to store an ID number for a given person, rather than the people themselves and all their respective 
    data each time they are processed. 
  </p>

  <p>
    With this setup, we can answer all kinds of questions about our data. For example, who are the students 
    with last names A through G majoring in Math who are also in their 20's? We can start with last names. 
    In our multimap of last names, we can quickly traverse the branches of the B+ tree to find the name closest
    to A (the first name in the data set), and we can also quickly and efficiently find the name closest to G by 
    nature of the B+ tree structure. Then, we can use the linked-list-like nature of the leaves of the B+ tree 
    to traverse each value (where each value holds a list of ID numbers for people) in this range directly and add
    all those values to a list. Now we have a list of every ID number of a person whose last name is between A and G 
    in the alphabet. 
  </p>

  <p>
    We can do this same thing to find the ID numbers of every person majoring in Math. This time, we look at the multimap
    (which is really a B+ tree) for the majors, and get the list of ID numbers that Math is the key for. In other words, 
    the major of Math will map to the list of everyone who has that major, in the form of their ID number. We can hold on to 
    that list to compare it with the list of ID numbers for names A through G to return our ultimate result, but we're not 
    done yet, we still need to figure out who is in their 20's!
  </p>

  <p>
    Using the multimap for age, we can once again harness the power of the B+ tree and iterate through every value where the 
    key is from 20 to 29 to get a list of every person's ID number who satisfies that condition. Now we have a list of 
    ID numbers for people in their 20's, a different list of ID numbers for people who are Math majors, and a third 
    list of ID numbers for those whose last name is between A and G in the alphabet. We can find the intersection of these 
    three lists of ID numbers to get the ultimate list of ID numbers of only the people we're looking for. With this 
    final list, we can go through it and map each ID number to the person it belongs to, thus giving us the people themselves 
    who fit our conditions. Just like that, we have processed a database query!
  </p>

  <p>
    This database query is similar to SQL queries, and would look like this:
  </p>

  <!-- <div class="spacer"></div> -->

  <code id="sql-query">select fname, lname from student where (lname >= a and lname &lt;= g) and major = math and (age >= 20 and age &lt; 30) </code>

  <!-- <div class="spacer"></div> -->

  <p style="padding-top: 1em;">
    With the help of a parser utilizing a graph representation of a finite state machine (pictured below) to interpret the queries, along with using stacks and queues to execute the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm" class="external_link" target="_blank">shunting yard</a> 
    and post-order traversal algorithms, statements like the one above are able to be processed, and we can make database queries!
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the course of this project, I learned so much about so many different things. I learned about data structures like Linked-lists, arrays, stacks, queues,
    trees, heaps, and graphs. I learned programming concepts like recursion and various searching and sorting algorithms. I programmed 
    all the previously mentioned data structures from scratch in C++ as well, so I got my hands dirty and learned how to work with pointers
    and memory, as well as debug more seg faults than I care to admit. With all that being said, working on this project and learning data 
    structures has been one of the most transformational experiences I've had in my programming career.
