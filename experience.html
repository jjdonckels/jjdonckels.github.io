    Leadership Experience
  </h2>

  <h3 class="sub-header">Eagle Scout</h3>

  <p>
    One of my proudest accomplishments is earning the rank of Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts. Earning Eagle Scout is something that 
    takes years of hard work, consistency, and effort to accomplish. It involves holding leadership positions in the troop where you 
    get a chance to plan meetings, events, and trips, as well as mentor younger scouts and be a model citizen in your community. To become 
    an Eagle Scout, you need to earn a minimum of 21 merit badges in various skills and disciplines including first aid, cooking, camping, 
    personal management, and citizenship. These merit badges help teach and reinforce core scouting values like service, hard work, respect, 
    and being prepared. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Perhaps the most important value in Boy Scouts is community service, and that's why every scout needs to carry out their own personal 
    community service project as another requirement to earn the rank of Eagle. This involves finding something to do that can benefit the 
    community, writing a proposal and going through an approval process with Scoutmasters and other administrators to ensure the integrity 
    and validity of the project, then proceeding to plan, fundraise, and execute the project. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I've been playing ice hockey since I was 8 years old. So when it was time for me to find a service project to do, I went to my town's local
    ice rink to find a project. When I first started playing hockey, I went to the very same ice rink and took skating lessons, and there was a program 
    where new and prospective players could be loaned hockey equipment that was donated and accumulated by other patrons over the years as people outgrew 
    their gear or simply didn't need it anymore. I was given everything I needed for free while I learned to skate and got a feel for the game, until I 
    got serious enough to buy my own gear. Sporting goods aren't cheap, and loaning beginners free gear while they tried out the sport was an amazing 
    way to decrease the barrier to entry and give people a taste of the game. If I had to buy hundreds of dollars worth of gear just to try hockey out 
    and see if it was for me, I don't think I would have ever given it the chance, but by being able to use donated equipment provided by the rink, I 
    fell in love with the game and have played it ever since. So, when I had to find a service project to do, I chose to help my ice rink and update their 
    donated equipment program. 
  </p>

  <p>
    When I first started my project, all the donated equipment was thrown into a single storage room with barely a hint of organization. 
    Helmets, gloves, skates, sticks, jerseys, and more were thrown onto shelves and in boxes with barely a second thought, and it was a 
    nightmare to find anything in the right spot, if at all. There were a few flimsy shelves that could have blown over in the wind, 
    and everything else was buried in decaying cardboard boxes on the floor. If a young child came in to get loaner gear like I did years ago, 
    it would be impossible to find the right equipment with the right fit in any reasonable amount of time. I wanted to change that. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For my Eagle Scout service project, I chose to give my ice rink's donated equipment room a complete overhaul, building new shelves for all 
    the gear and completely reorganizing it so that people could actually find what they were looking for. This was a huge project that called 
    for hundreds of pounds of materials, a budget in the thousands, and hundreds of hours of labor. 
  </p>

  <p>
    After weeks of careful planning, I was ready to start constructing the shelves that would house all the donated equipment. Building shelves 
    might sound simple enough. But in practice, it requires tremendous precision, careful planning, and a fair amount of skill to build a shelving 
    unit that is strong and stable. I led a team of about half a dozen people in the construction of 5 shelving units that were approximately 6 feet tall,
    4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep, along with building an additional rack to hold hockey sticks. Building these shelves taught me how to make a plan, accounting 
    for the smallest of details down to the millimeter, and how to adapt to changing circumstances. I iniitally designed the shelving units to be a certain 
    style with certain specifications, but what seems feasible in theory isn't always doable in practice, and I found out the design I'd originally drafted 
    would be too complicated and tedious for my team to build, given the resources at our disposal. As a result, I had to change my designs and plans for the 
    shelving units and go in a different direction. 
  </p>

  <p>
    After assembling the shelving units and stick rack out of wood, polishing and painting them, I was able to successfully deliver and 
    install them in the equipment room at the ice rink, and my team helped me reorganize the donated equipment, filling the shelves to the brim 
    and putting everything in its proper place, finally organized. What was once a nightmare of a mess was now a meticulously organized closet with rows and rows 
    of hockey and skating equipment ready to be used. Future prospective players would be able to find the right gear for them with ease, and they 
    too would have the opportunity to fall love with the sport I love. Below are pictures detailing the before, during, and after of this project.

  <p>
    My Eagle Scout service project taught me how to plan, how to make decisions, how to adapt to changes, and how to lead a team, valuable 
    skills that I carry with me to this day. I learned so much about all it takes to carry out and organize a large scale project, from 
    maintaining clear communication and logistics to delegating tasks to the best people fit for the job, to sticking to a plan and staying organized 
    to ensure things go smoothly. I was also able to give back to the ice rink that I grew up playing in, and that was special. Serving my community 
    by doing this project and becoming an Eagle Scout as a result is one of the most fulfilling and formative things I've ever done, and the lessons 
    I learned in the process and relationships I developed along the way are things that will be ingrained into my identity forever.
